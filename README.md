# Blindflug
A java app to find cheap flights with germanwings. The code is based on a flaw on the website of german wings.
For a couple of months back in 2014 and 2015 it was possible to see where ["blind booking"](https://www.germanwings.com/skysales/BlindBooking.aspx?culture=de-DE) flights would go.

This app made use of that flaw by letting you select your destination and trying blind booking until the desired destination would show up as the "secret" destination.

Since germanwings has removed the flaw from their website I am publishing my app.
